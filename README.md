# Block'em
Block’em is a Windows CLI application which can help in improving productivity by blocking away any distracting application/game for a given amount of time. It’s features:

- Ability to block any Windows app/process for a given amount of time. Apps/processes running as admin can also be blocked.
- Functionality to create multiple separate block-lists which can be used for different workflows anytime.
- Ability to start any block-list after a set break time.
- Generation of scores based on the app usage time.
- Archive of all previous Block’em usages with the block-lists used, time spent, usage date, etc.
- Audio alerts for starting and completion of a timer.

## Usage
Simply run main.py file using `python main.py` command. All the required packages will then be installed automatically.
