# App-Blocker (<em>Discontinued</em>)
 The CLI version of my App Blocker that I plan on converting to GUI soon.

 Currently I am just uploading the appblocker.py file, it runs in CLI and can itself download python modules needed for the complete code to run.

 **Also, since I wrote the code a while ago in IDLE when I was a complete begineer to coding, it doesn't follow the PEP 8 instructions and can also have some unsimplified piece of codes.**
